1. Starship Troopers
(The only good bug is a dead bug!)

2. Fight Club
(I honestly prefer the novel and I like lattes. Hardly a coincidence)

3. A Clockwork Orange
(No time for the old in-out love, I'm just here to read the meter.)

4. Summer Wars
(Love Machine remains the coolest movie villain ever.)

5. Oldboy
(Mind. Fucking. Blown)
